# unreal-rigify-grt

Blender plugin to automate the process of generating a GRT rig from a Rigify metarig for use with Unreal Engine (see https://twitter.com/kurethedead/status/1542913567107604480). This requires both GRT and Rigify addons to be installed and enabled.
Currently this is organized for my specific use cases, but it can be modified easily. The operator will appear in the Game Rig Tools tab in the 3D view at the bottom of the toolbar. To use it, select a Rigify metarig, then click the operator.
